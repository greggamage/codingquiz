The Coding Quiz page is a light blueish green background website with a start button and an empty box that displays Question.
After clicking on the start button, the question is filled with inner text information that displays the first question and brings up 4 multiple choice options for Answers.

The time starts counting down from 2 minutes and is displayed the entire time through the quiz.
When the correct answer is clicked, it highlights green.
When in incorrect answer is clicked, it is turned red to display that you have already chosen that answer and not to click it again, 15 seconds are deducted from your time left when a wrong answer is clicked.

The question is stored in innerttext document editing, and the answer is applied to one of the four answer boxes.
